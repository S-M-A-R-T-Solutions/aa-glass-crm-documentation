<Aside type="note">
    Every client needs to be associated with a contractor. This version does not include Contractor Creation from this modal selector, so you need to create the Contractor first. For more information, please refer to the <a href="/en/contractors/01--creating-a-contractor/">Contractor Creation Section</a>.

4. Add the Lead Source of the client by clicking in the Lead Source Dropdown Menu.
