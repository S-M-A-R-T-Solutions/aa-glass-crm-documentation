<Aside type="note">
    Jobs are the core component of the CRM. They act as the hub where Events, Tasks, Employees, Departments, Clients, and Contractors interact with each other. You can see more about Jobs in <a href="/en/jobs/01--creating-a-job/">Job Section</a>.
</Aside>

To add a job to a client from Clients Tab, there are two ways to do it:

### 1. Adding a Job to a Client

In Clients Tab, click on the marked icon:

![](/client/clients-9.webp)

A modal will appear. Fill in the fields with the job information according to the <a href="/en/jobs/01--creating-a-job/">Job Section</a>.

![](/client/clients-7.webp)

### 2. Adding a Job to a Client from Client Details

After creating a client, you can see the client details by clicking on the client name in the Clients List. In the client details, click on the "Add Job" button.

![](/client/clients-10.webp)

A modal will appear. Fill in the fields with the job information according to the <a href="/en/jobs/01--creating-a-job/">Job Section</a>.

![](/client/clients-11.webp)

<Aside type="note">
    In both cases, the job will be associated with the client and the contractor that is associated with the client by default.
