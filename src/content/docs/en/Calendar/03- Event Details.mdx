<Aside type="note">
    When you change the status of an event, the system will automatically update the event's progress. "Pending" events have a progress of 0%, "In Progress" events have a progress of 50%, and "Finished" events have a progress of 100%. This is specially useful when you check the completion of a task, because all the events related to a task contribute to the completion percentage of a Task. For more information, check the <a href="/en/status/02--checking-the-status-of-a-task/">Status of a Task section</a>.
