#### Adding Tasks to Employees

After setting up the Employee's information, you can assign tasks to the Employee. For this, check the Tasks you want the employee have access to.

#### Assigning Roles to the Employee

You can assign Roles to the Employee. Roles are a way to determine what the Employee can do in the system. For example, a Manager can create Jobs and assign them to Employees, while a regular Employee can only see the Jobs assigned to them.

    Every employee can have multiple roles, due to the flexibility required for the client's needs. Because of this, an employee will have the permissions of all roles assigned to it.
